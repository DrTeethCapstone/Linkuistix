Linkuistix is a word association game that uses an artificial intelligence that was trained by machine learning.  The AI, Tensor Flow Universal Sentence Encoder, created by Google, was trained by countless conversations on the internet and can predict words or phrases that might come next in a given conversation.

The AI allows us to present a set of words to the player and then rank how closely each of the presented words is associated with the player's input.  If the player inputs a word that is closely associated with the targeted word the player gets points added to their score and a new set of words is presented. The time the player has to input words decreases the more they play until eventually the player is unable to enter a closely associated word in time.  

Developed by Bilal Abbas, Noel Benford, Andrew Dobson, Bill Munkacsy, and Will Siddons. Linkuistix was created using Javascript, TensorFlow, Pixi.js, React.js, Node.js, and uses Firebase for deployment, and Firestore for the database.

We are proud and excited to present Linkuistix to you. Enjoy!
